<p>My first goal of life is to build a good educational website for all people who wants to study for free.
  This was my dream for a couple of years which I could not complete because of my study at university.
  Actually I chose this course because I knew that I will have to build a website.
  Moreover, I want to help my father with his business building for him a good e-commerce website.
  He will be happy to see me helping him in his business of selling and buying goods.</p>
